**Nerd that likes to be outside**

##Who Am I:
By day I lead Software Development teams with a specialty in ML. By night I ride bikes, climb rocks, ski mountains or train to get the most out of life. And you can generally find me outside on a random adventure anytime possible.

##My Journey:
Born in Canberra Australia I studied Engineering in Software at University of Canberra specialising in Biometric authentication and AI. My honours thesis was to develop a realtime pathfinding system in a dynamic environment on PS2 Hardware.
After what was to be the first of many Canadian holidays I returned to Canberra to work with an amazing team at CEA technologies developing radar control system. Here I worked alongside analysts and electronic engineers to put into production a full threat detection system. The problem we dealt with were incredibly complex and we were working directly with the hardware (low level)
I enjoyed my work but my heart was always in Canada and after many trips back I moved permanently to Canada in 2012 living in Revelstoke BC, skiing alot and taking a new direction with my career working for a not for profit in Avalanche safety. Here the problem were complex due to the limited resources available, but together we changes the landscape of public Avalanche forecasting in Canada. Building a new way of visualizing avlaanche safety information, building a crown sourcing network to obtain data from information blindspots. I took a brief hiatus to work as a tech lead at Amazon building data metadata system ontop of there big data infrastructure and working with data scientists in fraud, before returning to Avalanche Canada to work directly with a research team and avalanche forecasters to build new forecasting data and reporting tools. This was until covid changed the workld and funding dissapeared, so i took another pivot to work for tech startups. First a data passport tool and then Scribd the worlds largest online library where i started as a staff engineer and then quickly moved into a managment role. Here I lead a team building the Machine Learning Platform. Scribd's machine learning team was gorwing exponentially and the introduction of LLM's sped this up even further. 

##Working with me and my communication style:
I have worked in a variety of industries but I think working in the Avalanche Industry (both along side forecasters and as a tail guide) has probably taught me the most about communication.In this environment   
- It is very important to leave your ego at the door and have an environment where everyone feels comfortable discussing there observations and thoughts. It is important that even if you are not the leader you are willing to disagree or bring new thoughts to the table thus avoid [groupthink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink)
- Quick information is vital, and not all information needs to be polished. I work on the "Principle of least surprise" the idea being you want to be surprised as little as possible by having the pertinant information. When in the backcountry we are always talking about what we see even if the other person has seen this 
- You make a plan based on a hypothesis of current conditionas, but you must always be willing to take in new information and reasses as this information becomes available.  
Through this I have developed a communication style where I have a preference for:
- Candid respectful communication, even when it is uncomfortable. ("seeking to understand before being understood")[https://www.franklincovey.com/the-7-habits/habit-5/]
- Providing information quickly, this means in person communication is not always an option and there is not always time to polish this information fully. This might look like dropping a message in slack with a follow up document later on, rather than writing the document first.
- Talking about decisions. This includes recording decisions made, but also being willing to revisit or pivot if new information becomes available
