##Who Am I:
By day I lead Software Development teams with a specialty in ML. By night I ride bikes, climb rocks, ski mountains or train to get the most out of life.

##My Journey:
Born in Canberra Australia I studied Engineering in Software at University of Canberra specialising in Biometric authentication and AI. My honours thesis was to develop a realtime pathfinding system in a dynamic environment on PS2 Hardware.
After what was to be the first of many Canadian holidays I returned to Canberra to work with an amazing team at CEA technologies developing radar control system. Here I worked alongside analysts and electronic engineers to put into production a full threat detection system. The problem we dealt with were incredibly complex and we were working directly with the hardware (low level)
I enjoyed my work but my heart was always in Canada and after many trips back I moved permanently to Canada in 2012 living in Revelstoke BC, skiing alot and taking a new direction with my career working for a not for profit in Avalanche safety. Here the problem were complex due to the limited resources available, but together we changes the landscape of public Avalanche forecasting in Canada. Building a new way of visualizing avlaanche safety information, building a crown sourcing network to obtain data from information blindspots. I took a brief hiatus to work as a tech lead at Amazon building data metadata system ontop of there big data infrastructure and working with data scientists in fraud, before returning to Avalanche Canada to work directly with a research team and avalanche forecasters to build new forecasting data and reporting tools. This was until covid changed the workld and funding dissapeared, so i took another pivot to work for tech startups. First a data passport tool and then Scribd the worlds largest online library where i started as a staff engineer and then quickly moved into a managment role. Here I lead a team building the Machine Learning Platform. Scribd's machine learning team was gorwing exponentially and the introduction of LLM's sped this up even further. 

##Working with me and my communication style:
I have worked in a variety of industries but I think working in the Avalanche Industry (both along side forecasters and as a tail guide) has probably taught me the most about communication.  
In this environment it is very important to leave your ego at the door and have an environment where everyone feels comfortable discussing there observations and thoughts. It is important that even if you are not the leader you are willing to disagree or bring new thoughts to the table thus avoid [groupthink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink)
Also in this industry quick information is vital, and not all information needs to be polished. Principle of least surprise
Willing to Pivot and take in new information
